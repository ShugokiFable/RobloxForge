# RobloxForge -- uninstaller.
#
# This is the script that was actually missing. RobloxForge runs from its
# checkout, so deleting the folder was always "uninstalling" it -- except that
# it is NOT, because `skills install` and `agent connect` write into agent
# homes that the folder does not own. Delete the checkout and those entries
# stay behind: skills for a tool that is gone, and an MCP server entry pointing
# at a path that no longer exists.
#
# So the order here matters. Un-wire the agents FIRST, while the CLI that knows
# what it wrote still exists.
#
# The checkout itself is never deleted by this script -- it is your working
# copy, and removing a directory the user is standing in is not an
# uninstaller's job. It tells you the path and lets you decide.
